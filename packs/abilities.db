{"_id":"lHTGLvm2EMqQnNoN","name":"Lore: (Mystery Cult)","type":"ability","img":"icons/svg/aura.svg","data":{"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Mystery Cult) Lore is the (Organization) Lore of a particular cult. It provides knowledge of the legends, history, structure, operation, and goals of the Mystery Cult in question. It includes knowledge of the magics, rites, and secret passwords and symbolism of the cult, how to covertly signal membership, and how to assess another magus&rsquo;s membership or non-membership in the cult. Two magi with this Ability for the same Mystery Cult may well be able to hold a seemingly innocuous conversation without outsiders realizing that a second, secret, conversation is hidden within the innocent phrases. In order to prevent outsiders from learning secrets of the Mystery, many Mystery Cults&rsquo; specialty books require a score in this Ability for a magus to decode their symbolism. (Mystery Cult) Lore also covers the ceremonies of the cult, frequently enacted when the cult members gather formally. It is a key knowledge for a Mystagogue&rsquo;s performance of the Initiation rites, to guide the Initiate through Ordeals, ceremonies, and meditations to gain new Virtues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Knowledge of this Ability is passed from Mystagogue to Initiate, from mystae to mystae, in a chain of living secrets. Some cults also write down their secret lore, as this codifies the Mystery and lets others share the same view of the cult. Others prefer the secrecy of an oral tradition. Small cults may fade away from lack of members, especially if they are persecuted, but if they have committed some of their lore to writing, the cults may be restarted by those who discover and understand the texts.

This is usually an animal&nbsp;or bird, but it can be a plant. The heartbeast is&nbsp;always a living thing, and usually a noble creature.&nbsp;No known magus has had an earthworm&nbsp;heartbeast, for example. A maga&rsquo;s heartbeast displays a central aspect of her nature, so that her personality, even in human form, will&nbsp;resemble that of the creature. Initiates of the&nbsp;Bjornaer mystery gain the Ability Heartbeast.&nbsp;This Ability cannot be gained by any character&nbsp;who has not been initiated into the mystery. For initiates of the Outer Mystery, the&nbsp;Heartbeast Ability is only used when something&nbsp;tries to stop the magus changing forms.&nbsp;In that case, a roll of Stamina + Heartbeast&nbsp;against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide&nbsp;allows the character to change anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Bjornaer maga can only change into&nbsp;one kind of animal, and that kind cannot be&nbsp;altered by Hermetic magic. The transformed Bjornaer can be changed, by Muto Animal magic, for example, but the kind of animal that&nbsp;her heartbeast is cannot be changed. A Bjornaer maga really is her heartbeast, and so remaining in that form does not count as being&nbsp;under an active mystical effect (see &ldquo;Warping,&ldquo;&nbsp;page 167). Of course, she is really human as&nbsp;well, so remaining human does not cause warping&nbsp;either. Hermetic magic is unable to tell whether an animal is actually a Bjornaer, and&nbsp;the same applies to most other kinds of magic.&nbsp;(This assumes that the maga is trying to hide&nbsp;her nature, of course.) As a result, a Bjornaer in&nbsp;animal form is affected by Animal spells, not&nbsp;Corpus or Mentem spells. Spells already in&nbsp;effect before the transformation remain in&nbsp;effect, however.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bjornaer magi can cast spells while in the&nbsp;form of their heartbeast, but they cannot speak&nbsp;or make the appropriate gestures, and thus normally&nbsp;take a &ndash;15 penalty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The transformation takes only a moment,&nbsp;and affects only the maga. None of her possessions are transformed. A Bjornaer who has been&nbsp;physically changed by magic may try to assume&nbsp;her normal form or her heartbeast form. She&nbsp;must roll Stamina + Heartbeast against an Ease&nbsp;Factor set by the storyguide. As a rule of&nbsp;thumb, 3 + the magnitude of the transforming magic is a reasonable number. If she does&nbsp;resume one of her natural forms, the other&nbsp;magic is dispelled.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bjornaer magi do not treat physical transformations&nbsp;as major magical effects for the purposes&nbsp;of gaining Warping Points. However, a&nbsp;magical transformation which is maintained&nbsp;over time will grant one Warping Point per&nbsp;year, as it is still a continuing mystical effect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, Bjornaer magi cannot bind familiars.&nbsp;The reasons for this are debated, but the&nbsp;fact is uncontroversial.</p>","source":"ArM5","page":91,"defaultChaAb":"int","speciality":"","xp":0,"key":"heartbeast","option":"","score":0,"experience":0,"version":"1.3.2"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4OxU3E57BM9ttwDI":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.core.d63fGIoFuBoo5M7T"},"cf":{"id":"temp_328ngj04y11","path":"Abilities#/CF_SEP/Supernatural","color":"#000000"}}}

Criamon apprentices learn to view events and objects in unusual and intuitive ways, usually by meditating on 15 riddles related to the Arts. This training helps them to find connections between concepts, and place this knowledge into the context of the Enigma. This in turn allows Criamon magi to understand the nature of humans, the universe, and the ties between them in ways incomprehensible to other magi. Once a magus has grasped the foundational elements of wisdom, he may develop deeper understanding by considering the insights of others, which can be transmitted through books, discussion, or mystical experiences.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 6pt; text-align: justify;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Symbolic Understanding</span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">A Criamon magus may use his Enigmatic Wisdom score to understand subtle symbols.

They can tell whether a character has been Warped, and how severely, with a Perception + Enigmatic Wisdom roll against an Ease Factor six or more, and if they beat an Ease Factor of 12, they understand, in general terms, what sort of life experience caused the Warping.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">This Ability also assists with interpreting dreams and visions.

A labyrinth meditation is a non-magical ritual during which the magus walks slowly through a maze while contemplating a problem. Many contemplation mazes are simple ribbons, with a single path leading to a center, then out again. Simple contemplative labyrinths can be created with low-level spells.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">The magus&rsquo;s mental state remains focused for an hour after he completes the labyrinth. This allows a bonus on a single roll. This can be used to untangle a single conundrum (an Enigmatic Wisdom roll), recall a single fact (a Lore roll), or perform a single physical action. Physical actions must take no longer than one minute (ten combat rounds). The bonus is equal to half the magus&rsquo;s Enigmatic Wisdom score.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">The magus must have a score of at least one in the required Ability before it can be assisted by labyrinth meditations. Meditations add grace to the magus&rsquo;s thoughts and actions, but do not grant conscious skill. A magus who does not know how to swim, for example, cannot use the clarity of thought and action provided by the meditation to swim.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">Characters with an Enigmatic Wisdom score of three or more don&rsquo;t need a physical labyrinth; they can walk in a circle for the same effect. Those with a score of six or more don&rsquo;t even need to walk &mdash; they can imagine the circle. Labyrinth rituals take sixteen hours for characters with a score of one in Enigmatic Wisdom. The time required halves for each level they gain. Characters with brief meditation times cannot, however, perform several meditations and save or stack the bonuses.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 6pt; text-align: justify;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Twilight</span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">Criamon magi understand Twilight better than other magi, and so navigate it more safely.
